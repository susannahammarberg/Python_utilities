in ipython console type:

dir()
to see a list of all availiable objects e.g. 'loaded' modules, classes, vaiables


to get more information about the objects type
help(objectname)           [Very nice for ptypy they have written documentation strings]

on containers use:
	P.diff.info()
to get size, memory usage etc


also use print object
to get info. list the attributes?

CTRL + <RETURN> executes the current cell (menu enty Run -> Run cell). 
A cell is defined as the code between two lines which start with the agreed tag #%%

Run ptypy in iPython. then you need to open  a new consol (Consoles->open new..)
and close the old one to be able to run it again.
